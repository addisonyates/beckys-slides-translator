# Google Slides Translator

A [Google Workspace add-on](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/overview) for translating Google Slides presentations to other languages. Created for my friend Becky who teaches at a high school in Dallas.

## Overview

This code is based on Google's [sample translate add-on](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/samples/translate-addon-sample). Whereas that add-on lets users translate individual text selections, this add-on is intended to translate entire presentations.
